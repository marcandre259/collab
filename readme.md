# Collab
Project to get movie recommendations for me and friends. Started to try out a deep-learning approach to collaborative filtering.

Added a user-level fine-tuning chunk to get recommendations for new users or based on new user reviews without having to retrain the whole model, or without having to use a heuristic.

The project a fastapi api but no front-end. It be ran as a docker container.
